# Comments:
#   dig_graves.py extracts/reports data for a collection of stashed "Find a Grave" memorial pages.
#   Schema:
#      log = create a log file
#      cemetery_id : group, group, ...
#      cemetery_id = numeric Find a Grave cemetery ID
#      valid groups = burial, parent, spouse, child, sibling, half-sibling
#   Colon (:) separates cemetery_id and groups
#   Comma (,) separates groups
#   cemetery_id without group(s) will convert to include all groups
#   For data integrity, if getting all groups, get a fresh copy of all burials.
#   If "log" appears by itself on a line, start a log file.
#   Examples:
#      2136908 : child
#      2136908 : burial, parent, spouse, child, sibling, half-sibling
#      2136908 (converts to ...)
#      2136908 : family (converts to ...)
#      2136908 : burial, parent, spouse, child, sibling, half-sibling
